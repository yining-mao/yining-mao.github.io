Hi, I am **Yining Mao (茅一宁)**, a senior undergraduate student at [Zhejiang University (**ZJU**)](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in the [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/main.psp), majoring in [Computer Science and Technology (**CS**)](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/). My research interests currently lie in **Machine Learning** and **Computer Vision**, but I am still trying and exploring new possibilities in academic interests and career paths :)

Recently, I have finished our work on *Learning Graph Neural Networks on Image Style Transfer* (submitted to *ECCV*'2022), collaborating with Ph.D. candidate Yongcheng Jing, advised by *Prof. Xinchao Wang* at National University of Singapore. I am also fortunate to have done some research at the [**ZJU-VIPA**](https://www.vipazoo.cn/) research group on knowledge distillation,  Transformers, GANs, few-shot learning, etc., under the supervision of *Prof. Mingli Song*. Moreover, I was a full-time research intern at [Zhejiang Lab](https://en.zhejianglab.com/) for six months.

You can check out my latest [**📝CV/Resume**](/files/YiningMao-CV.pdf) for more information. Details of my research and publications will be updated soon!
