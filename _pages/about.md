Hi, I am **Yining Mao (茅一宁)**, a 1st-year Master student at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu) in Electrical Engineering (**EE**). I received my B.E from [Zhejiang University (**ZJU**)](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) majoring in Computer Science and Technology (**CS**) in June, 2022. My research interests currently lie in **Machine Learning** and **Computer Vision**, but I am still trying and exploring new possibilities in academic interests and career paths :)

Currently, I work as a research intern in the Stanford AI Lab supervised by Prof. [James Zou](https://www.james-zou.com), where I have conducted several projects on [*Biases in GPT detectors*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.02819.pdf) and 
[*subpopulation shifts*](https://moonshape.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (*ICML*'2023).
Previously, I had a summer research internship on [*Style Transfer with GNNs*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11681) (*ECCV*'2022), advised by *Prof. [Xinchao Wang](https://sites.google.com/site/sitexinchaowang/)* at the National University of Singapore (NUS). During my undergraduate study, I was fortunate to have worked at the [**ZJU-VIPA**](https://www.vipazoo.cn/) research group on knowledge distillation [(SDB)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.03695.pdf),  Transformers, GANs, few-shot learning, etc., under the supervision of *Prof. [Mingli Song](https://vipazoo.cn/people/songmingli.html)*. Moreover, I was a full-time research intern in [Zhejiang Lab](https://en.zhejianglab.com/) for six months.

You can check out my latest [**📝CV/Resume**](/files/YiningMao-CV-0926.pdf) for more information. Details of my research and publications will be updated soon.
